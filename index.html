      <h2>About Demon Slayer:</h2>
      <p>
        It follows teenage Tanjiro Kamado, who strives to become a Demon Slayer
        after his family was slaughtered and his younger sister, Nezuko, turned
        into a demon.

      <h2>Tanjiro Characteristics</h2>
      <p>
        Tanjiro is kind by nature and has been described by others as having
        very gentle eyes. He exhibits a great deal of determination and will not
        give up once he has a goal to achieve; the best example of this is his
        relentless quest to find a cure for Nezuko.
      </p>

      <h2>Nezuko Characteristics</h2>
      <p>
        Nezuko was a kind and caring girl, who thought of others before herself
        much like her older brother, Tanjiro, and was a responsible older sister
        to her younger siblings. Nezuko is, however, not afraid to get in harm's
        way, protecting her friends from Demons even after being returned to a
        human state.
